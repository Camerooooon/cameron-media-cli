# Archived: My website is no longer running this version of the API and wont be running it for the forseable future

# cameron-media-cli
A command line interface for my website's API

```
cmcli help - opens this help page
cmcli version - gets the version
cmcli key <key> - checks the status of your key
cmcli status - checks the status of the cameron.media api
cmcli statusraw - checks the status of the cameron.media api but returns either 1 for online or 0 for offline
cmcli upload <file> <key> - uploads a file to the cameron.media api
```

Only help and version commands work as of now.
The uploading part of this CLI doesn't work without a valid key.
